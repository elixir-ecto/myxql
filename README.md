# MyXQL

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elixir-ecto/myxql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elixir-ecto/myxql)

MySQL driver for Elixir.

Documentation: <http://hexdocs.pm/myxql>

## Features

  * Automatic decoding and encoding of Elixir values to and from MySQL text and binary protocols
  * Supports transactions, prepared queries, streaming, pooling and more via [DBConnection](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/db_connection)
  * Supports MySQL 5.5+, 8.0, and MariaDB 10.3
  * Supports `mysql_native_password`, `sha256_password` (\*), and `caching_sha2_password` (\*)
    authentication plugins

\* These authentication methods require either an SSL connection or the server must exchange its public key during handshake.

## Usage

Add `:myxql` to your dependencies:

```elixir
def deps() do
  [
    {:myxql, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Make sure you are using the latest version!

```elixir
iex> {:ok, pid} = MyXQL.start_link(username: "root")
iex> MyXQL.query!(pid, "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS blog")

iex> {:ok, pid} = MyXQL.start_link(username: "root", database: "blog")
iex> MyXQL.query!(pid, "CREATE TABLE posts IF NOT EXISTS (id serial primary key, title text)")

iex> MyXQL.query!(pid, "INSERT INTO posts (`title`) VALUES ('Post 1')")
%MyXQL.Result{columns: nil, connection_id: 11204,, last_insert_id: 1, num_rows: 1, num_warnings: 0, rows: nil}

iex> MyXQL.query(pid, "INSERT INTO posts (`title`) VALUES (?), (?)", ["Post 2", "Post 3"])
%MyXQL.Result{columns: nil, connection_id: 11204, last_insert_id: 2, num_rows: 2, num_warnings: 0, rows: nil}

iex> MyXQL.query(pid, "SELECT * FROM posts")
{:ok,
 %MyXQL.Result{
   columns: ["id", "title"],
   connection_id: 11204,
   last_insert_id: nil,
   num_rows: 3,
   num_warnings: 0,
   rows: [[1, "Post 1"], [2, "Post 2"], [3, "Post 3"]]
 }}
```

It's recommended to start MyXQL under supervision tree:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      {MyXQL, username: "root", name: :myxql}
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

and then we can refer to it by its `:name`:

```elixir
iex> MyXQL.query!(:myxql, "SELECT NOW()").rows
[[~N[2018-12-28 13:42:31]]]
```

## Mariaex Compatibility

See [Mariaex Compatibility](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/myxql/blob/master/MARIAEX_COMPATIBILITY.md) page for transition between drivers.

## Data representation

```
MySQL                Elixir
-----                ------
NULL                 nil
bool                 1 | 0
int                  42
float                42.0
decimal              #Decimal<42.0> *
date                 ~D[2013-10-12] **
time                 ~T[00:37:14]
datetime             ~N[2013-10-12 00:37:14] **, ***
timestamp            ~U[2013-10-12 00:37:14Z] ***
json                 %{"foo" => "bar"} ****
char                 "Ã©"
text                 "myxql"
binary               <<1, 2, 3>>
bit                  <<1::size(1), 0::size(1)>>
point, polygon, ...  %Geo.Point{coordinates: {0.0, 1.0}}, ... *****
```

\* See [Decimal](https://github.com/ericmj/decimal)

\*\* When using SQL mode that allows them, MySQL "zero" dates and datetimes are represented as `:zero_date` and `:zero_datetime` respectively.

\*\*\* Datetime fields are represented as `NaiveDateTime`, however a UTC `DateTime` can be used for encoding as well

\*\*\*\* MySQL added a native JSON type in version 5.7.8, if you're using earlier versions,
remember to use TEXT column for your JSON field.

\*\*\*\*\* See "Geometry support" section below

## JSON support

MyXQL comes with JSON support via the [Jason](https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason) library.

To use it, add `:jason` to your dependencies:

```elixir
{:jason, "~> 1.0"}
```

You can customize it to use another library via the `:json_library` configuration:

```elixir
config :myxql, :json_library, SomeJSONModule
```

## Geometry support

MyXQL comes with Geometry types support via the [Geo](https://github.com/bryanjos/geo) package.

To use it, add `:geo` to your dependencies:

```elixir
{:geo, "~> 3.3"}
```

Note, some structs like `%Geo.PointZ{}` does not have equivalent on the MySQL server side and thus
shouldn't be used.

If you're using MyXQL geometry types with Ecto and need to for example accept a WKT format as user
input, consider implementing an [custom Ecto type](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Type.html).

## Contributing

Run tests:

```
git clone git@github.com:elixir-ecto/myxql.git
cd myxql
mix deps.get
mix test
```

See [`scripts/ci.sh`](scripts/ci.sh) and [`scripts/test-versions.sh`](scripts/test-versions.sh) for scripts used to test against different server versions.
